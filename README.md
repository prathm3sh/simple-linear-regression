# simple-linear-regression
Simple linear regression is a supervised machine learning technique used to predict a dependent variable from a single independent variable.
After understanding the concepts and the code you will have a clear idea about simple linear regression.
formula used :
y(DV)=b0+b1*x(IDV)
where,
y=dependent variable
b0=constant
b1=regression coefficient
x=independent variable
